# Synchronization Enhancement Plan

## Steps to Complete:

1. [x] Review and enhance synchronization error handling in main.py
2. [x] Implement user confirmation dialog for synchronization in GUI (already implemented)
3. [ ] Test automatic synchronization functionality
4. [x] Update logging for better synchronization tracking (already implemented)
5. [x] Verify ZKTeco device connection robustness (already implemented)
6. [ ] Test complete synchronization workflow
7. [ ] Update main TODO.md with completed tasks

## Current Status:
- Enhanced error handling in main.py with better connection management
- Added automatic reconnection attempts during synchronization
- Improved logging with detailed sync logs in database
- Return values added to synchronization methods for better tracking
- Ready for testing phase
